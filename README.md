# AI-DRIVEN-GLAUCOMA-SUSCEPTIBILITY-ASSESSMENT-AND-LIFESTYLE-GUIDANCE


This project addresses the global health challenge posed by glaucoma, a progressive and irreversible eye disease affecting millions worldwide. Recognizing the critical importance of timely detection and intervention for managing the condition and preventing irreversible vision loss, our initiative focuses on developing an innovative Python-based application. This application utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning.
In our pursuit to enhance glaucoma diagnosis and management, we have chosen to implement the VGG16 model with transfer learning. Originally designed for image classification tasks, this pre-trained model enables automated classification of glaucoma severity into distinct categories, including No_DR, Proliferate_DR, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. The strategic use of transfer learning allows us to leverage the wealth of knowledge acquired by VGG16 from extensive image datasets, optimizing its performance for our specific application.
The core of our project lies in the creation of a user-friendly interface using the tkinter library, ensuring seamless interaction for individuals seeking to assess their eye health. Users can effortlessly upload their eye images through the application, initiating a real-time analysis process. Going beyond mere classification, our application offers personalized medical advice based on the predicted severity. This includes tailored recommendations for treatment options, lifestyle adjustments, and the importance of regular eye check-ups.
By integrating advanced machine learning technology with an intuitive design, our tool aims to empower individuals to actively manage their eye health. The potential to slow down the progression of glaucoma through early detection and informed decision-making becomes a tangible reality. Ultimately, our application strives to not only detect glaucoma at its early stages but also to guide users towards proactive measures, significantly enhancing their overall quality of life. This comprehensive approach seeks to make a meaningful impact on the global health landscape, addressing the pressing issue of glaucoma and offering a valuable tool for individuals to take control of their eye health.
